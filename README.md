# LED_Sound_Control
It is a sound LED control on bluepill STM32F103C8T6. It doesn't use HAL library but works on registers. To speed up the work I used CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) <br> <br>

### Components:
STM32F103C8T6 <br>
ST-LINK V2 <br>
LED RGB (in my case, a common anode) <br>
Sound sensor ky-037 <br>
Resistors 150, 100, 100 Ohm <br>
